## Brief ##

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Johann Felipe Gonzalez Avila, or Felipe Gonzalez if you prefer. I am tech passionated!. I obtained 2 engineer undergrad degrees in Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia (The country in South America). One in Electronic Engineering and the secon in Systems and Computing Engineeering. Later I obtained a Ms.C in Systems and Computing Engineering in the same university. During my undergrad I did an international exchange in the *Institut National des Sciences AppliquÃ©es INSA (Lyon, France)* with a 10-month internship in the *Centre de Recherche en Acquisition et Traitement de l'Image pour la SantÃ© (CREATIS)*. In my Ms.C, with the *Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program (ELAP)* bourse I participated as a visitor student researcher in CIL at Carleton.

Nowadays, I am a Ph.D. student in Information Technology in cosupervision between Carleton University (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) and UniversitÃ© de Lille (Lille, France) with an emphasis in HCI conducting research about personal fabrication.
